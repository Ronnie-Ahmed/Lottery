# Lottery Dapp

🐧 🐧 Lottery Dapp 🐧🐧

The Decentralized Lottery Dapp is an innovative project that leverages blockchain technology to bring the excitement of lotteries to the Ethereum network.



🎟️ How it Works:

✔️ As the owner of the smart contract, I have implemented exclusive rights to initiate new lottery sessions.

✔️ Users can buy lottery tickets using Ether, but I have thoughtfully incorporated a limit to ensure fair participation and prevent any monopolization.

✔️ Each lottery session is time-limited, adding an extra layer of excitement and encouraging prompt participation from users.

✔️ When the session time expires, I have implemented a function that declares the lucky winner based on their lottery ticket number.

✔️ The total Ether collected throughout the session is then transferred directly to the winner's account, utilizing the power of decentralized finance (DeFi) to facilitate secure and transparent prize distribution.
